  "content": "Each tool in this toolkit is rated on the following three dimensions:\n## Cost (0–10)\n0 means free. 10 means expensive. This measures affordability. Is this realistic for a freelance journalist or small newsroom or is it priced for a well-funded organisation?\n## Difficulty (0–10)\n0 means “click and go.” 10 means advanced technical or coding skills are required. This indicates how much technical knowledge is needed to use the tool effectively.\n## Invasiveness (0–10)\n0 means the tool runs locally or offline and keeps data on your own device. 10 means your data is uploaded, stored, or used to train external models. This reflects the privacy and security trade-offs involved in using the tool.\n## How to read the CDI score\nA cloud-based transcription service might have a CDI score of 3–1–6:\n- Cost: 3 — affordable for most journalists.\n- Difficulty: 1 — simple, drag-and-drop interface.\n- Invasiveness: 6 — audio files are uploaded to external servers.\nThis tells students and lecturers that the tool is easy to use and affordable, but may be unsuitable for sensitive interviews.\nBy contrast, an open-source transcription tool that runs locally might score 0–8–0:\n- Cost: 0 — free.\n- Difficulty: 8 — requires considerable technical setup.\n- Invasiveness: 0 — data never leaves the device.\nThis makes it a better option for high-risk reporting, even though it is harder to use.\nThe CDI score is not a verdict. It is a conversation starter. When teaching classes, it helps students understand trade-offs, compare tools responsibly and make informed decisions based on their resources, skills and security needs."
