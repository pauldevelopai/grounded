  "content": "Instructors are advised to encourage students to run every tool through this grid before use.\n## 1. Data Sovereignty\nThis is the idea that determines who controls data, where it is processed, which laws apply to it and who can access it at every stage of its use.\nQuestions you need to ask:\n- Where does my data go when I use this tool?\n- Is my data stored, logged, or reused after the task is completed?\nScoring:\n- 0 = No sovereignty (worst case). Data is uploaded to the cloud, stored, logged, and reused for model training.\n- 5 = Full sovereignty (best case). Local processing only. User controls storage, deletion and access.\n## 2. Exportability\nThis is the ability to retrieve, move and reuse your data without lock-in.\nQuestions you need to ask:\n- Can I export my data in open, machine-readable formats (such as CSV, JSON, or plain text)?\nScoring:\n- 0 = No exportability (worst case). Data cannot be exported and outputs are locked inside a proprietary interface.\n- 5 = Full exportability (best case). All data can be exported instantly, no restrictions and the data does not degrade when you export it.\n## 3. Business Model\nSpecifically, how the company makes money and whether your data is part of the product.\nQuestions you need to ask:\n- Is the pricing clear and predictable? Does the company sell, share, or monetize user data or metadata?\nScoring:\n- 0 = Extractive model (worst case). Vague or shifting terms of service and user data used for training, analytics or resale.\n- 5 = Aligned and transparent model (best case). Revenue comes from clear, upfront payment (subscription, licence, or one-time fee). User data is not sold, shared, or reused beyond delivering the service. Terms of service are stable, readable, and explicit about data use.\n## 4. Security\nThe tool should protect your accounts, content and access from others.\nQuestions you need to ask:\n- Does the tool support strong authentication, such as two-factor or multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA)?\nScoring:\n- 0 = Insecure (worst case). Single-password login only, no clear encryption practices and very weak access controls.\n- 5 = Strong security (best case). End-to-end encryption or strong at-rest encryption coupled with clear access control, logging and recovery mechanisms.\nTotal score out of 20."
